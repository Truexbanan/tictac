Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. You can play against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.

How to Play
Choose your difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Impossible.
The game board will be displayed as a 3x3 grid, and each cell is numbered from 1 to 9.
Take turns with the AI opponent to select a spot on the board by entering the corresponding number.
The goal is to get three symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If you or the AI opponent successfully get three in a row, the game ends and the winner is announced.
If all spots on the board are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.
Setup and Execution
Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
Compile the Java file AI.java using the Java compiler.
Run the compiled file to start the game.
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the difficulty level and play the game.
