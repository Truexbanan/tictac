# Tic-Tac-Toe Console Game

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. You can play against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels.

## How to Play

1. Choose your difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Impossible.
2. The game board will be displayed as a 3x3 grid, and each cell is numbered from 1 to 9.
3. Take turns with the AI opponent to select a spot on the board by entering the corresponding number.
4. The goal is to get three symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. If you or the AI opponent successfully get three in a row, the game ends and the winner is announced.
6. If all spots on the board are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Setup and Execution

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
2. Compile the Java file `AI.java` using the Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled file to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the difficulty level and play the game.
